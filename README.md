Website for Unity Global Initiative Scholarship

The Instructions folder contains the information I have on how the website should look.

All page styles are combined into a single CSS which contains some vestigial code. Ideally this should be cleaned up and potentially split among a number of CSS before deployment. The same is true to a lesser extent for the script files.

The application page should be implemented as a webform with emails sent upon submission (allong with JS form validation to ensure all fields have sufficient responses).
